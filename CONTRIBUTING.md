## Welcome!

### Code of conduct

We aspire to create a welcoming environment for collaboration on this project.
To that end, we follow the [18F Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)
and ask that all contributors do the same.

### Getting started

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to an 18F open source project!
If you're unsure or afraid of anything, just ask or submit the issue or pull
request anyways. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to
change something. We appreciate any sort of contribution, and don't want a wall
of rules to get in the way of that.

Before contributing, we encourage you to read our CONTRIBUTING policy (you are
here), our [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and our [README](REAMDE.md). If you have any
questions, or want to read more about our underlying policies, you can consult
the [18F Open Source Policy GitHub
repository](https://github.com/18f/open-source-policy), or just shoot us an
email/official government letterhead note to [18f@gsa.gov](mailto:18f@gsa.gov).

### Submitting a pull request

1. Fork the repository or create a branch if you are part of the 18F Team on
   GitHub
2. Implement your feature or bug fix (and add test coverage if applicable)
3. Run the tests (`$ ./go test`) to make sure nothing is broken
4. Add, commit, and push your changes
5. [Submit a pull
   request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
6. Another contributor will merge your pull request into master when it is deemed
   ready
